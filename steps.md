# Mobile-First Activity Design System - Chunked Implementation Plan

## OVERVIEW
This document outlines a step-by-step mobile-first design system implementation for the activity section, broken into small, manageable chunks to prevent errors and ensure smooth execution.

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
- Each chunk focuses on 1-2 specific components
- Changes are isolated to prevent cascading errors
- Testing after each chunk before proceeding
- Incremental improvements maintaining existing functionality

- Add transition animations

### Success Criteria:
- All tabs meet 48px minimum touch target
- Smooth transitions on state changes
- Proper visual feedback on tap

### How to Verify Success:
1. Navigate to `/groups/:id` (any group page)
2. Use browser dev tools to inspect tab button heights - should be minimum 48px

## DESIGN TOKENS (Applied Throughout)

### Touch Targets
```css
/* Primary actions (post reactions) */
.touch-target-primary { min-height: 48px; min-width: 48px; }

/* Secondary actions (comment reactions) */
.touch-target-secondary { min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px; }
```

### Spacing System
```css
/* Mobile-first spacing */
.spacing-mobile-container { padding: 0.75rem; }
.spacing-mobile-gap { gap: 0.75rem; }
.spacing-mobile-section { margin-bottom: 1rem; }

/* Desktop spacing */
.spacing-desktop-container { padding: 1.5rem; }
.spacing-desktop-gap { gap: 1rem; }
.spacing-desktop-section { margin-bottom: 1.5rem; }
```

### Color System
```css
/* Semantic colors for states */
.state-active-primary { background: hsl(var(--primary) / 0.1); color: hsl(var(--primary)); }
.state-hover-primary { background: hsl(var(--primary) / 0.05); }
.state-active-blue { background: hsl(217 91% 60% / 0.1); color: hsl(217 91% 60%); }
.state-active-red { background: hsl(0 84% 60% / 0.1); color: hsl(0 84% 60%); }
```

### Transitions
```css
/* Standard transitions */
.transition-standard { transition: all 200ms ease-in-out; }
.transition-touch { transition: transform 150ms ease-out; }
.transition-color { transition: background-color 200ms ease-in-out, color 200ms ease-in-out; }
```

## TESTING CHECKLIST

### After Each Chunk:
- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum requirements
- [ ] Visual states work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design functions properly
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Final Validation:
- [ ] All touch targets 48px+ (primary) or 44px+ (secondary)
- [ ] Consistent spacing throughout activity section
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast compliance
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] Performance optimization maintained

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
Execute chunks 1-12 in sequence, testing after each chunk before proceeding to the next. This ensures any issues are caught early and can be addressed without affecting the entire system.
