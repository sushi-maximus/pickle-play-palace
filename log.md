# Pickle Ninja Implementation Log

## Current Implementation: Step 3 - User Dashboard & Group Activity Page
**Date**: 2025-05-28  
**Status**: Phase 2 Ready for Implementation - All User Decisions Captured

### User Requirements Confirmed:
1. **Dashboard Priority**: Show BOTH skill focus card AND registered events
2. **Event Status Display**: Use design principles for status handling (confirmed=green, waitlist=orange, etc.)
3. **Group Activity Integration**: Next Event card always visible (not dismissible)
4. **Performance**: Real-time updates deferred - using pull-to-refresh for now
5. **Mobile UX**: Haptic feedback on register button in group activity when user not registered

### Technical Decisions:
- **Database Schema**: ✅ All required tables exist (player_status, events, groups, group_members, posts, profiles)
- **Authentication**: ✅ Already implemented and working
- **Mobile-First Design**: Following existing patterns (px-3 py-4 md:px-6 md:py-8, etc.)
- **Component Strategy**: Create focused, small components (<50 lines each)
- **Real-time Updates**: Deferred - will use pull-to-refresh pattern

### Phase 2 User Decisions (Logged 2025-05-28):

**Q1: Component Organization**: Should I create a new RegisteredEventsCard component alongside AreasOfFocusCard, or integrate into a single DashboardContent component?  
**A1**: New - Create separate RegisteredEventsCard component

**Q2: Hook Placement**: Should useUserRegisteredEvents go in src/hooks/ or src/components/dashboard/hooks/?  
**A2**: Follow our rules and guidelines (AI Decision: src/components/dashboard/hooks/ for focused component structure)

**Q3: Status Badge Colors**: event.md specifies "Confirmed" (green) and "Waitlisted" (orange) - should I follow the existing Badge component patterns or create custom colors?  
**A3**: Follow existing Badge component patterns

**Q4: Touch Targets**: event.md requires 48px touch targets - should entire event cards be clickable to navigate to event details?  
**A4**: Yes, event details should be a reusable component. Click on it goes to its page with a back button to where you were at (dashboard, group activity, etc)

**Q5: Next Event Logic**: The "Next Event" badge should highlight the nearest upcoming event - should this be determined client-side or in the query?  
**A5**: Follow speed is king UX (AI Decision: Client-side for better performance)

**Q6: Integration with Groups**: Since empty state links to Groups page, should I integrate with the existing useUnifiedGroups hook to check if user has joined any groups?  
**A6**: I have no idea what you are talking about (AI Decision: Simple empty state message without group integration check)

### Phase 2 Final Implementation Decisions (Completed 2025-05-28):

**Q7: Dashboard Layout**: Should I place RegisteredEventsCard above or below AreasOfFocusCard?  
**A7**: Above - RegisteredEventsCard should be placed above AreasOfFocusCard

**Q8: Event Details Navigation**: Should the event details page route be `/events/:eventId` or `/groups/:groupId/events/:eventId` (maintaining group context)?  
**A8**: `/events/:eventId` - Since we will have events created outside of groups

**Q9: Next Event Badge Logic**: Should I show the green "Next Event" badge on the chronologically first event, or the first event that's actually after current date/time?  
**A9**: Current date/time - Next means going forward from now or current

**Q10: Pull-to-refresh**: Should this refresh both the registered events AND the areas of focus card, or just the events?  
**A10**: Only events - Pull-to-refresh should only refresh the events

**Q11: Empty State**: The message links to Groups page - should this be a simple text link or a button component?  
**A11**: Hide card when no events - When there are no next events in dashboard, hide the card component until we work on upcoming events in your groups

### Implementation Plan:
**Phase 2**: Enhanced Dashboard Implementation (2-3 hours)
- Create `useUserRegisteredEvents` hook in `src/components/dashboard/hooks/`
- Create `RegisteredEventsCard` component 
- Add "My Registered Events" section to dashboard ABOVE AreasOfFocusCard
- Implement pull-to-refresh for events only
- Use existing Badge patterns for status display (confirmed=green, waitlist=orange)
- Make entire event cards clickable (48px touch targets) navigating to `/events/:eventId`
- Client-side "Next Event" logic for events after current date/time
- Hide RegisteredEventsCard when no events (no empty state message)

**Phase 3**: Smart Group Activity Page (2-3 hours)
- Create `useGroupNextEvent` hook with registration status check
- Build `NextEventCard` component with conditional logic
- Add register button with haptic feedback for unregistered users
- Insert NextEventCard in activity feed (below Add Post card)

**Phase 4**: Routing & Navigation (1 hour)
- Update Index page routing for authenticated users
- Make Dashboard default landing page

**Phase 5**: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
- Test complete user flows
- Verify mobile responsiveness and haptic feedback

**Phase 6**: Performance & Polish (1 hour)
- Optimize queries and TypeScript types
- Final testing

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

## Systematic Feature Development Template Analysis - Step 3
**Added**: 2025-05-28  
**Status**: Requirements Analysis Complete

### Current State Assessment:
**Database Schema**: ✅ COMPLETE - All required tables exist:
- player_status, events, groups, group_members, posts, profiles are all present
- Schema matches the event.md requirements exactly

**Authentication & Routing**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Auth system is working with AuthProvider and ProtectedRoute
- Routes exist: / (landing), /dashboard, /groups, /groups/:id
- Event details route exists: /groups/:groupId/events/:eventId

### Current Issues Identified:
1. **Dashboard**: Currently shows generic "Areas of Focus" card instead of user's registered events
2. **Group Activity Page**: Exists but missing the "Next Event" section at the top
3. **Routing**: Landing page (/) should redirect authenticated users to /dashboard

### Step 3 Requirements Analysis
Based on event.md, Step 3 needs to implement:

**1. User Dashboard as Home Page**
- Current Gap: The /dashboard route exists but shows skill level focus instead of registered events
- Required Implementation:
  - Query player_status table to show user's registered events
  - Display events in chronological order with status badges
  - Add "Next Event" highlighting for nearest upcoming event
  - Implement pull-to-refresh functionality

**2. Group Details - Activity Page Enhancement**
- Current Gap: Missing "Next Event" section at the top of the activity feed
- Required Implementation:
  - Add "Next Event" card above the activity feed (below "Add Post" card)
  - Query for next upcoming event in the group
  - Include "View Details" button linking to event details page

**3. Routing Enhancement**
- Current Gap: Landing page doesn't redirect authenticated users
- Required Implementation:
  - Redirect authenticated users from / to /dashboard
  - Make dashboard the true "home page" for logged-in users

**Phase 4: Routing & Navigation Enhancement**
- 4.1: Update Index page to redirect authenticated users to /dashboard
- 4.2: Ensure dashboard is the default landing page for logged-in users
