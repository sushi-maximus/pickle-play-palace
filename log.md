## Current Implementation: Step 3 - User Dashboard & Group Activity Page
**Date**: 2025-05-28  
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

### User Requirements Confirmed:
1. **Dashboard Priority**: Show BOTH skill focus card AND registered events
2. **Event Status Display**: Use design principles for status handling (confirmed=green, waitlist=orange, etc.)
3. **Group Activity Integration**: Next Event card always visible (not dismissible)
4. **Performance**: Real-time updates deferred - using pull-to-refresh for now
5. **Mobile UX**: Haptic feedback on register button in group activity when user not registered

### Technical Decisions:
- **Database Schema**: ✅ All required tables exist (player_status, events, groups, group_members, posts, profiles)
- **Authentication**: ✅ Already implemented and working
- **Mobile-First Design**: Following existing patterns (px-3 py-4 md:px-6 md:py-8, etc.)
- **Component Strategy**: Create focused, small components (<50 lines each)
- **Real-time Updates**: Deferred - will use pull-to-refresh pattern

### Implementation Plan:
**Phase 2**: Enhanced Dashboard Implementation (2-3 hours)
- Create `useUserRegisteredEvents` hook
- Create `useUserGroupEvents` hook  
- Add "My Registered Events" section to dashboard
- Add "Available Group Events" section to dashboard
- Implement pull-to-refresh and mobile-first design

**Phase 3**: Smart Group Activity Page (2-3 hours)
- Create `useGroupNextEvent` hook with registration status check
- Build `NextEventCard` component with conditional logic
- Add register button with haptic feedback for unregistered users
- Insert NextEventCard in activity feed (below Add Post card)

**Phase 4**: Routing & Navigation (1 hour)
- Update Index page routing for authenticated users
- Make Dashboard default landing page

**Phase 5**: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
- Test complete user flows
- Verify mobile responsiveness and haptic feedback

**Phase 6**: Performance & Polish (1 hour)
- Optimize queries and TypeScript types
- Final testing

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

### Next Action:
Ready to begin Phase 2 - Enhanced Dashboard Implementation

## Systematic Feature Development Template Analysis - Step 3
**Added**: 2025-05-28  
**Status**: Requirements Analysis Complete

### Current State Assessment:
**Database Schema**: ✅ COMPLETE - All required tables exist:
- player_status, events, groups, group_members, posts, profiles are all present
- Schema matches the event.md requirements exactly

**Authentication & Routing**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Auth system is working with AuthProvider and ProtectedRoute
- Routes exist: / (landing), /dashboard, /groups, /groups/:id
- Event details route exists: /groups/:groupId/events/:eventId

### Current Issues Identified:
1. **Dashboard**: Currently shows generic "Areas of Focus" card instead of user's registered events
2. **Group Activity Page**: Exists but missing the "Next Event" section at the top
3. **Routing**: Landing page (/) should redirect authenticated users to /dashboard

### Step 3 Requirements Analysis
Based on event.md, Step 3 needs to implement:

**1. User Dashboard as Home Page**
- Current Gap: The /dashboard route exists but shows skill level focus instead of registered events
- Required Implementation:
  - Query player_status table to show user's registered events
  - Display events in chronological order with status badges
  - Add "Next Event" highlighting for nearest upcoming event
  - Implement pull-to-refresh functionality

**2. Group Details - Activity Page Enhancement**
- Current Gap: Missing "Next Event" section at the top of the activity feed
- Required Implementation:
  - Add "Next Event" card above the activity feed (below "Add Post" card)
  - Query for next upcoming event in the group
  - Include "View Details" button linking to event details page

**3. Routing Enhancement**
- Current Gap: Landing page doesn't redirect authenticated users
- Required Implementation:
  - Redirect authenticated users from / to /dashboard
  - Make dashboard the true "home page" for logged-in users

### Detailed Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Database Schema Validation** ✅
- Status: COMPLETE - All required tables exist and match event.md specifications

**Phase 2: Dashboard Home Page Implementation**
- 2.1: Create hook useUserRegisteredEvents to query player_status + events tables
- 2.2: Replace AreasOfFocusCard with RegisteredEventsCard component
- 2.3: Implement pull-to-refresh and "Next Event" highlighting
- 2.4: Add empty state with link to Groups page
- 2.5: Add mobile-first responsive design patterns

**Phase 3: Group Activity Page Enhancement**
- 3.1: Create hook useGroupNextEvent to query next upcoming event
- 3.2: Create NextEventCard component for activity feed
- 3.3: Insert NextEventCard above existing activity feed (below Add Post card)
- 3.4: Add "View Details" button linking to event details page
- 3.5: Handle empty state when no upcoming events exist

**Phase 4: Routing & Navigation Enhancement**
- 4.1: Update Index page to redirect authenticated users to /dashboard
- 4.2: Ensure dashboard is the default landing page for logged-in users
- 4.3: Update navigation to highlight dashboard as "Home"

**Phase 5: Testing & Polish**
- 5.1: Test user flows from registration to dashboard view
- 5.2: Test group activity page with and without upcoming events
- 5.3: Verify mobile responsiveness and touch targets
- 5.4: Add error handling and loading states

**Phase 6: Integration & Performance**
- 6.1: Optimize queries with proper indexing
- 6.2: Add proper TypeScript types following rules.md guidelines
- 6.3: Implement caching and preloading where beneficial
- 6.4: Final testing and user acceptance
