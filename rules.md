# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Change Protocol

### Core Principle: Make ONLY What's Requested
1. **Make ONLY the specific change requested** - nothing more, nothing less
2. **If code is working, don't modify the JavaScript logic** - only change what was explicitly asked for
3. **CSS changes = CSS only** - don't touch state management, hooks, or business logic
4. **Before making ANY change, explicitly state what will be modified and what will be preserved**

## Verification Before Changes
- "This change will modify X while preserving Y and Z"
- If changing styling: only modify className/styles
- If changing logic: only modify the specific logic mentioned
- Never "improve" working code unless explicitly asked

## Component Change Protocol

When working on any component changes that may affect other components, you MUST:

1. **Request explicit permission** before making changes that touch multiple components
2. **List all affected components** clearly before proceeding
3. **Wait for user approval** before implementing cross-component changes
4. **Focus only on the specific component requested** unless given permission to modify others

### Protected Components (require extra caution)
- All post and comment components (MobilePostCard2, CommentsSection2, Comment2, CommentForm2, etc.)
- Navigation components (BottomNavigation, MobilePageHeader, etc.)
- Layout components (AppLayout, MobileLayout, etc.)
- Any component the user has marked as "finished"

### When in doubt
- Ask first, code second
- Err on the side of requesting permission
- Never assume cross-component changes are acceptable

## TypeScript Best Practices

### CRITICAL: Never Use 'any' Types

**MANDATORY TYPE IMPORTS**: Always import types from the database schema:
```typescript
import type { Database } from "@/integrations/supabase/types";
```

**STANDARD GROUP TYPE PATTERN**: For any component working with groups, use this exact pattern:
```typescript
type Group = Database['public']['Tables']['groups']['Row'] & {
  members?: GroupMember[];
  member_count: number;
};
```

**STANDARD PROFILE TYPE**: For user profiles, always use:
```typescript
type Profile = Database['public']['Tables']['profiles']['Row'];
```

**COMPONENT PROPS RULES**:
- NEVER use any in interface definitions
- Always import existing types from their respective files
- Use proper generic types for callbacks

**REQUIRED IMPORTS FOR GROUP COMPONENTS**:
```typescript
import type { Database } from "@/integrations/supabase/types";
import type { GroupMember } from "./members/types";
import type { Profile } from "../posts/hooks/types/groupPostTypes";
```

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS**:
- `group: any` → Use `group: Group`
- `user: any` → Use `user: Profile | null`
- `onUpdate: (data: any) => void` → Use proper typed callbacks

**TYPE EXTENSION PATTERN**: When adding computed fields to database types, use intersection types:
```typescript
type ExtendedGroup = Database['public']['Tables']['groups']['Row'] & {
  additionalField: string;
};
```

## Code Modification Guidelines

### WORKFLOW
Changes are made ONLY as requested. Cleanup/optimization happens ONLY when explicitly asked for.

### PRESERVATION FIRST APPROACH
1. Always identify what exists before making changes
2. Explicitly preserve anything not mentioned in the request
3. When modifying arrays or objects, update specific properties rather than replacing entire structures
4. When changing imports, add new imports alongside existing ones unless removal is specifically requested

### CHANGE VERIFICATION
- Before implementing: "This change will modify X while preserving Y and Z"
- After implementing: Verify all original functionality remains unless explicitly removed

### PERMISSION REQUIRED
- ANY changes beyond what's explicitly requested must be approved first
- This includes "obvious" fixes, ID changes, import updates, etc.
- Even if changes seem necessary for functionality, ask permission first

### CHANGE TYPES
- Normal requests: Make ONLY the requested changes, preserve everything else
- Cleanup requests: Only when explicitly asked to "optimize", "clean up", or "find unused code" should broader code analysis and removal happen

## Navigation Component Rules

**CRITICAL**: When modifying UI navigation components, always preserve ALL existing functionality unless explicitly asked to remove it.

- When changing labels or icons, modify ONLY the requested elements
- When adding imports, ADD to existing imports, don't replace the entire import line
- When modifying the tabs array, update individual properties, don't replace the entire array

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: Before making any changes to navigation components, explicitly list what will be preserved vs what will be changed.

## Main Entry Point Setup Rules

**CRITICAL**: Main Entry Point Setup Rules

1. **NEVER modify main.tsx to render anything other than the root App component**
   - Always render `<App />` in main.tsx
   - NEVER render `<AppRouter />` or any sub-components directly
   - This ensures all providers are properly initialized

2. **Provider Hierarchy (must be maintained)**:
   - App.tsx contains: QueryClientProvider, AuthProvider, ThemeProvider, etc.
   - AppRouter.tsx handles routing logic
   - Individual pages/components consume the providers

3. **React Query Requirements**:
   - All components using useQuery, useMutation, etc. MUST be wrapped in QueryClientProvider
   - QueryClientProvider is set up in App.tsx
   - If you bypass App.tsx, React Query will throw "No QueryClient set" error

4. **If you need to modify routing**:
   - Make changes in AppRouter.tsx or AppRoutes.tsx
   - NEVER change what gets rendered in main.tsx
   - Keep the App → QueryClientProvider → AppRouter hierarchy intact

5. **Common error patterns to avoid**:
   - Rendering routing components directly in main.tsx
   - Moving provider setup out of App.tsx
   - Creating new entry points that bypass the provider chain

## Database Types

Always use the database types from `@/integrations/supabase/types` instead of defining custom types. For profiles, use `Database['public']['Tables']['profiles']['Row']` rather than creating a separate Profile type. This ensures type consistency across the entire application.

## Essential Architecture Guidelines

### Component Structure
- Create small, focused files (50 lines or less)
- Use separate files for every component/hook
- Always use database types from `@/integrations/supabase/types`

### Lazy Loading
- Add new pages to `src/pages/lazy/index.ts` using `createLazyComponent()`
- Use `LazyPageName` imports in routes
- Keep Login/Signup/Index eager-loaded

### Mobile-First Design
- Use `px-3 py-4 md:px-6 md:py-8` padding pattern
- Include mobile (`h-3 w-3`) and desktop (`md:h-4 md:w-4`) icon sizing
- Use `space-y-3 md:space-y-4` for consistent spacing

### Performance
- Performance monitoring only on Admin page
- Use `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, `useCallback()` for optimization
- Wrap routes with RouteLoader and RouteErrorBoundary

### Preloading
- Use `OptimizedNavLink` for navigation with preload capabilities
- Hover/focus events automatically preload routes
